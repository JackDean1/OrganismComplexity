Genetic studies in yeast have identified more than 40 vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) genes involved in vesicle transport to vacuoles. This gene encodes the human homolog of yeast class C Vps16 protein. The mammalian class C Vps proteins are predominantly associated with late endosomes/lysosomes, and like their yeast counterparts, may mediate vesicle trafficking steps in the endosome/lysosome pathway. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. ",Entezgene summary
VPS18,"Vesicle mediated protein sorting plays an important role in segregation of intracellular molecules into distinct organelles. Genetic studies in yeast have identified more than 40 vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) genes involved in vesicle transport to vacuoles. This gene encodes the human homolog of yeast class C Vps18 protein. The mammalian class C Vps proteins are predominantly associated with late endosomes/lysosomes, and like their yeast counterparts, may mediate vesicle trafficking steps in the endosome/lysosome pathway",Entezgene summary
VPS26A,"This gene belongs to a group of vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) genes. The encoded protein is a component of a large multimeric complex, termed the retromer complex, involved in retrograde transport of proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network. The close structural similarity between the yeast and human proteins that make up this complex suggests a similarity in function. Expression studies in yeast and mammalian cells indicate that this protein interacts directly with VPS35, which serves as the core of the retromer complex. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.",Entezgene summary
VPS29,"This gene belongs to a group of vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) genes that, when functionally impaired, disrupt the efficient delivery of vacuolar hydrolases. The protein encoded by this gene is a component of a large multimeric complex, termed the retromer complex, which is involved in retrograde transport of proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network. This VPS protein may be involved in the formation of the inner shell of the retromer coat for retrograde vesicles leaving the prevacuolar compartment. Alternative splice variants encoding different isoforms and representing non-protein coding transcripts have been found for this gene",Entezgene summary
VPS33A,"This gene encodes a tethering protein and a core subunit of the homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) complex. The HOPS complex and a second endosomal tethering complex called the class C core vacuole/endosome tethering (CORVET) complex, perform diverse functions in endocytosis including membrane tethering, RabGTPase interaction, activation and proofreading of synaptic-soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) assembly to drive membrane fusion, and endosome-to-cytoskeleton attachment. The HOPS complex controls endosome maturation as well as endosome traffic to the lysosome. This complex is essential for vacuolar fusion and is required for adaptor protein complex 3-dependent transport from the golgi to the vacuole. The encoded protein belongs to the Sec1/Munc18 (SM) family of SNARE-mediated membrane fusion regulators. Naturally occurring mutations in this gene are associated with a novel mucopolysaccharidosis-like disease.",Entezgene summary
YEATS4,"The protein encoded by this gene is found in the nucleoli. It has high sequence homology to human MLLT1, and yeast and human MLLT3 proteins. Both MLLT1 and MLLT3 proteins belong to a class of transcription factors, indicating that the encoded protein might also represent a transcription factor. This protein is thought to be required for RNA transcription. This gene has been shown to be amplified in tumors. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.",Entezgene summary
